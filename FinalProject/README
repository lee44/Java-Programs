All files are part of a group project in which we created a super mario based game. 
We built everything from scratch which includes sound, hit detection, physics, sprite images,
animations, layout design for our game. My responsibility was handling hit detection and
designing the layout for our game. For hit detection, I simply surrounded each object with rectangles 
and created a method that checked if any other object was inside its boundaries. For the layout, I used
a txt file and drew the level with a bunch of numbers where 1 signified a sprite image of the ground and 2 
represented obstacles. A method would read txt file and render the level.
